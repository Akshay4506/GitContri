# Comprehensive Website Accessibility Audit

## Instructions

In this assignment, you'll conduct a professional-level accessibility audit of a real website, applying the principles and techniques you've learned. This hands-on experience will deepen your understanding of accessibility barriers and solutions.

Choose a website that appears to have accessibility issues‚Äîthis gives you more learning opportunities than analyzing an already-perfect site. Good candidates include older websites, complex web applications, or sites with rich multimedia content.

### Phase 1: Strategic manual evaluation

Before reaching for automated tools, perform a comprehensive manual assessment. This human-centered approach often reveals issues that tools miss and helps you understand the real user experience.

**üîç Essential evaluation criteria:**

**Navigation and Structure:**
- Can you navigate the entire site using only keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys)?
- Are focus indicators clearly visible on all interactive elements?
- Does the heading structure (H1-H6) create a logical content outline?
- Are there skip links to jump to main content?

**Visual Accessibility:**
- Is there sufficient color contrast throughout the site (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)?
- Does the site rely solely on color to convey important information?
- Do all images have appropriate alternative text?
- Does the layout remain functional when zoomed to 200%?

**Content and Communication:**
- Are there any "click here" or ambiguous link texts?
- Can you understand the content and functionality without visual cues?
- Are form fields properly labeled and grouped?
- Are error messages clear and helpful?

**Interactive Elements:**
- Do all buttons and form controls work with keyboard alone?
- Are dynamic content changes announced to screen readers?
- Do modal dialogs and complex widgets follow proper accessibility patterns?

üìù **Document your findings** with specific examples, screenshots, and page URLs. Note both issues and things done well.

### Phase 2: Comprehensive automated testing

Now validate and expand your manual findings using industry-standard accessibility testing tools. Each tool has different strengths, so using multiple tools gives you complete coverage.

**üõ†Ô∏è Required testing tools:**

1. **Lighthouse Accessibility Audit** (built into Chrome/Edge DevTools)
   - Run audit on multiple pages
   - Focus on specific metrics and recommendations
   - Note your accessibility score and specific violations

2. **axe DevTools** (browser extension - industry standard)
   - More detailed issue detection than Lighthouse
   - Provides specific code examples for fixes
   - Tests against WCAG 2.1 criteria

3. **WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator** (browser extension)
   - Visual representation of accessibility features
   - Highlights both errors and positive features
   - Great for understanding page structure

4. **Color Contrast Analyzers**
   - WebAIM Contrast Checker for specific color pairs
   - Browser extensions for page-wide analysis
   - Test against both WCAG AA and AAA standards

**üéß Real assistive technology testing:**
- **Screen reader testing**: Use NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (Mac), or TalkBack (Android)
- **Keyboard-only navigation**: Unplug your mouse and navigate the entire site
- **Zoom testing**: Test functionality at 200% and 400% zoom levels
- **Voice control testing**: If available, try voice navigation tools

**üìä Organize your results** by creating a master spreadsheet with:
- Issue description and location
- Severity level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- WCAG success criteria violated
- Tool that detected the issue
- Screenshots and evidence

### Phase 3: Comprehensive findings documentation

Create a professional accessibility audit report that demonstrates your understanding of both technical issues and their human impact.

**üìã Required report sections:**

1. **Executive Summary** (1 page)
   - Website URL and brief description
   - Overall accessibility maturity level
   - Top 3 most critical issues
   - Estimated impact on users with disabilities

2. **Methodology** (¬Ω page)
   - Testing approach and tools used
   - Pages evaluated and device/browser combinations
   - Standards evaluated against (WCAG 2.1 AA)

3. **Detailed Findings** (2-3 pages)
   - Issues categorized by WCAG principle (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)
   - Include screenshots and specific examples
   - Note positive accessibility features you found
   - Cross-reference with automated tool results

4. **User Impact Assessment** (1 page)
   - How identified issues affect users with different disabilities
   - Scenarios describing real user experiences
   - Business impact (legal risk, SEO, user base expansion)

**üì∏ Evidence collection:**
- Screenshots of accessibility violations
- Screen recordings of problematic user flows
- Tool reports (save as PDFs)
- Code examples showing issues

### Phase 4: Professional remediation plan

Develop a strategic, prioritized plan for fixing accessibility issues. This demonstrates your ability to think like a professional web developer addressing real business constraints.

**üéØ Create detailed improvement recommendations (minimum 10 issues):**

**For each identified issue, provide:**

- **Issue Description**: Clear explanation of what's wrong and why it's problematic
- **WCAG Reference**: Specific success criteria violated (e.g., "2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) - Level A")
- **User Impact**: How this affects people with different disabilities
- **Solution**: Specific code changes, design modifications, or process improvements
- **Priority Level**: Critical (blocks basic usage) / High (significant barrier) / Medium (usability issue) / Low (enhancement)
- **Implementation Effort**: Time/complexity estimate (Quick win / Moderate effort / Major refactor)
- **Testing Verification**: How to verify the fix works

**Example improvement entry:**

```
Issue: Generic "Read more" link text appears 8 times on homepage
WCAG Reference: 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) - Level A
User Impact: Screen reader users cannot distinguish between links when viewed in link list
Solution: Replace with descriptive text like "Read more about sustainability initiatives"
Priority: High (major navigation barrier)
Effort: Low (30 minutes to update content)
Testing: Generate link list with screen reader - each link should be meaningful standalone
```

**üìà Strategic implementation phases:**

- **Phase 1 (0-2 weeks)**: Critical issues that block basic functionality
- **Phase 2 (1-2 months)**: High-priority improvements for better user experience
- **Phase 3 (3-6 months)**: Medium-priority enhancements and process improvements
- **Phase 4 (Ongoing)**: Continuous monitoring and enhancement
