Letâ€™s dive into variables and the data types they hold!

## Variables

Variables are used to store values that can be accessed and modified throughout your code.

To **declare** a variable, use the syntax **[keyword] [name]**. This consists of two parts:

- **Keyword**. Keywords can be `let` or `var`.  

âœ… The `let` keyword, introduced in ES6, provides _block scope_ for your variable. Itâ€™s recommended to use `let` instead of `var`. Weâ€™ll explore block scopes in more detail later.
- **Variable name**. This is a name you choose for your variable.

### Task - Working with Variables

1. **Declare a variable**. Use the `let` keyword to declare a variable:

    ```javascript
    let myVariable;
    ```

   `myVariable` has now been declared using the `let` keyword, but it doesnâ€™t have a value yet.

1. **Assign a value**. Use the `=` operator to store a value in the variable.

    ```javascript
    myVariable = 123;
    ```

   > Note: In this lesson, the `=` operator is used as an "assignment operator" to set a value to a variable. It does not mean equality.

   `myVariable` is now *initialized* with the value 123.

1. **Refactor**. Replace your code with the following statement:

    ```javascript
    let myVariable = 123;
    ```

    This is called _explicit initialization_, where a variable is declared and assigned a value at the same time.

1. **Change the variable value**. Update the variableâ€™s value like this:

   ```javascript
   myVariable = 321;
   ```

   Once a variable is declared, you can change its value at any point in your code using the `=` operator and the new value.

   âœ… Try it! You can write JavaScript directly in your browser. Open Developer Tools, go to the console, and type `let myVariable = 123`. Press return, then type `myVariable`. What happens? Youâ€™ll learn more about these concepts in upcoming lessons.

## Constants

Declaring and initializing a constant is similar to a variable, but you use the `const` keyword. Constants are often written in uppercase letters.

```javascript
const MY_VARIABLE = 123;
```

Constants are like variables, but with two key differences:

- **Must have a value**. Constants must be initialized, or an error will occur when the code runs.
- **Reference cannot be changed**. Once initialized, the reference of a constant cannot be changed, or an error will occur. Letâ€™s look at two examples:
   - **Simple value**. The following is NOT allowed:
   
      ```javascript
      const PI = 3;
      PI = 4; // not allowed
      ```
 
   - **Object reference is protected**. The following is NOT allowed:
   
      ```javascript
      const obj = { a: 3 };
      obj = { b: 5 } // not allowed
      ```

    - **Object value is not protected**. The following IS allowed:
    
      ```javascript
      const obj = { a: 3 };
      obj.a = 5;  // allowed
      ```

      In this case, youâ€™re changing the value of the object but not its reference, which is allowed.

   > Note: A `const` protects the reference from reassignment. However, the value itself is not _immutable_ and can change, especially for complex constructs like objects.

## Data Types

Variables can hold different types of values, such as numbers or text. These types of values are called **data types**. Understanding data types is crucial for software development because it helps developers decide how to write code and how the software should behave. Additionally, some data types have unique features that allow you to transform or extract more information from a value.

âœ… Data types are also known as JavaScript data primitives, as they are the most basic data types provided by the language. There are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, null, and symbol. Take a moment to think about what each of these might represent. What is a `zebra`? How about `0`? `true`?

### Numbers

In the previous section, the value of `myVariable` was a number data type.

`let myVariable = 123;`

Variables can store all kinds of numbers, including decimals and negative numbers. Numbers can also be used with arithmetic operators, which are covered in the [next section](../../../../2-js-basics/1-data-types).

### Arithmetic Operators

Here are some common operators for performing arithmetic operations:

| Symbol | Description                                                              | Example                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `+`    | **Addition**: Adds two numbers                                           | `1 + 2 //expected answer is 3`   |
| `-`    | **Subtraction**: Subtracts one number from another                       | `1 - 2 //expected answer is -1`  |
| `*`    | **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers                               | `1 * 2 //expected answer is 2`   |
| `/`    | **Division**: Divides one number by another                              | `1 / 2 //expected answer is 0.5` |
| `%`    | **Remainder**: Finds the remainder when dividing two numbers             | `1 % 2 //expected answer is 1`   |

âœ… Try it! Test an arithmetic operation in your browserâ€™s console. Were the results what you expected?

### Strings

Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

- `'This is a string'`
- `"This is also a string"`
- `let myString = 'This is a string value stored in a variable';`

Always use quotes when writing a string; otherwise, JavaScript will assume itâ€™s a variable name.

### Formatting Strings

Strings are textual and often need formatting.

To **concatenate** two or more strings (combine them), use the `+` operator.

```javascript
let myString1 = "Hello";
let myString2 = "World";

myString1 + myString2 + "!"; //HelloWorld!
myString1 + " " + myString2 + "!"; //Hello World!
myString1 + ", " + myString2 + "!"; //Hello, World!

```

âœ… Why does `1 + 1 = 2` in JavaScript, but `'1' + '1' = 11?` Think about it. What happens with `'1' + 1`?

**Template literals** offer another way to format strings. Instead of quotes, use backticks. Anything that isnâ€™t plain text must be placed inside `${ }`, including variables.

```javascript
let myString1 = "Hello";
let myString2 = "World";

`${myString1} ${myString2}!` //Hello World!
`${myString1}, ${myString2}!` //Hello, World!
```

Both methods can achieve your formatting goals, but template literals preserve spaces and line breaks.

âœ… When would you choose a template literal over a plain string?

### Booleans

Booleans have only two possible values: `true` or `false`. They are useful for making decisions about which lines of code should execute under certain conditions. Often, [operators](../../../../2-js-basics/1-data-types) are used to set the value of a Boolean, and youâ€™ll frequently see variables being initialized or updated with an operator.

- `let myTrueBool = true`
- `let myFalseBool = false`

âœ… A variable is considered 'truthy' if it evaluates to a boolean `true`. Interestingly, in JavaScript, [all values are truthy unless defined as falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Truthy).

## ðŸš€ Challenge

JavaScript is known for its surprising behavior with data types. Research some of these quirks. For example: case sensitivity can be tricky! Try this in your console: `let age = 1; let Age = 2; age == Age` (returns `false` -- why?). What other quirks can you discover?
