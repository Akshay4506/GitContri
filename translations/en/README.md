## üè´ Pedagogy

Our curriculum is designed with two key teaching principles in mind:
* project-based learning
* frequent quizzes

The program covers the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, along with the latest tools and techniques used by modern web developers. Students will gain hands-on experience by building a typing game, virtual terrarium, eco-friendly browser extension, space-invader-style game, and a banking app for businesses. By the end of the series, students will have a solid understanding of web development.

> üéì You can take the first few lessons in this curriculum as a [Learn Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/web-development-101/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) on Microsoft Learn!

By aligning the content with projects, the learning process becomes more engaging for students, and concept retention is enhanced. We also created several introductory lessons on JavaScript basics, paired with videos from the "[Beginners Series to: JavaScript](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-JavaScript/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon)" collection, some of which were authored by contributors to this curriculum.

Additionally, a low-stakes quiz before class helps set the student's focus on the topic, while a second quiz after class reinforces retention. This curriculum is designed to be flexible and enjoyable, and it can be taken in full or in part. The projects start small and gradually increase in complexity over the 12-week cycle.

While we intentionally avoided introducing JavaScript frameworks to focus on the foundational skills needed as a web developer before adopting a framework, a great next step after completing this curriculum would be learning about Node.js through another video series: "[Beginner Series to: Node.js](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-Nodejs/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon)".
